# Pyhton-scripts
Python scripts used for automating data acquisition and NN training

The aim of this work is to develop a new machine learning method for predicting the mechanical behavior of soft biological tissues to replace the use of constitutive laws by an artificial neural network. The data used for training the neural network were obtained by Abaqus simulation, which required Pyhton scripts for writing the appropriate values on text files. In another hand, Python code for the extraction of data of these text files were necessary. In those code is the calculation of the different physical parameters that need to be computed to predict the strain energy density function as a function of the invariants. Then, an implementation of an artificial neural network using Tensorflow is made to assess the accuracy of such a method on different mechanical tests.
